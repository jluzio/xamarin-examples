-- HTTP --
Added Microsoft.Net.Http for Core and UWP libs (required both?)
Added System.Net.Http for Android and iOS 
  (don't know if is required, read somewhere iOS and Android have this lib)
Added modernhttpclient in all modules. It enabled Android to access a HTTPS resource.

-- REST --
Added Newtonsoft.Json to Core module. It was supposed to add to other modules, check if it is so, but it worked for now
